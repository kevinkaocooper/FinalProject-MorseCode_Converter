## Morse Code Converter

This website helps you to convert your text into morse code.

## Summary

Creating a website that allows people to input the words and translate it into morse code. 

While you are typing the word, the website will play the morse code sound.

## Component Parts

I ended up using HTML, CSS and jQuery to build the website.

## Challenges

I found a similar jQuery that did what I want it to do. Figuring it out how to use the jQuery is one of the challenge.
